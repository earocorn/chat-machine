# chat-machine
File-based chat-room I created when I was ~13 years old. Yeah, that's why it looks like that.

The `Core.bat` is a batch script that generates 3 batch files: 
- ChatMachine.bat
    - This is where you choose a nickname for the chatroom and begin messaging.
- ChatClear.bat
    - Small "administrative" feature to clear the main chatroom log.
- chatLogger.bat
    - Displays the current chat
